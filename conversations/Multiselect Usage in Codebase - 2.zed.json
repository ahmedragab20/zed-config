To find where multiselect components are being used in your codebase, you could try:\n\n1. Searching for common multiselect component names:\n   - `<MultiSelect>`\n   - `<Select multiple>`\n   - `<Multiselect>`\n   - `multiple={true}` (for select components)\n\n2. Looking for imports of multiselect libraries:\n   - `import { MultiSelect }` \n   - `import Multiselect`\n   - Popular libraries like react-select, vue-multiselect, etc.\n\n3. Searching for CSS classes related to multiselect:\n   - `.multiselect`\n   - `.select-multiple`\n\nIf you can provide more details about your codebase (language, framework, repository structure), I can give more specific guidance on how to locate multiselect implementations.\n/file  where in the codebase where we're using a multiselect\nI don't have access to your codebase, so I can't directly examine your files to find where a multiselect component is being used. \n\nThe \"/file\" command you used doesn't work in this chat interface. To find multiselect usage in your codebase, you would need to:\n\n1. Use search tools on your local machine or repository:\n   ```\n   grep -r \"multiselect\\|multiple=\" --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.jsx\" --include=\"*.tsx\" .\n   ```\n\n2. Or use your IDE's search functionality to find:\n   - Component names like `<MultiSelect>`, `<Multiselect>`\n   - Props like `multiple={true}` or `isMulti={true}`\n   - CSS classes related to multiselect\n\nIf you're working with a specific UI library (Material UI, Chakra, etc.), you could search for that library's multiselect component implementation.\n\nIf you can share specific files or code snippets, I'd be happy to help identify multiselect usage in them.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":75}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":27},"start":57,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":76}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":887,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":77}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":948,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":78}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":63},"start":1834,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":79}}}],"summary":"Multiselect Usage in Codebase","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
